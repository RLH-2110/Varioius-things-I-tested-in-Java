These are various java projects that I made to test stuff.
Mostly undocumented.

These Java projects don't need to make sense. I just want to see what I can do.

These will be, for example, a class to implement unsigned bytes or a class for values with decimals, like floats without floats. 
Not really needed, but fun to try out.
